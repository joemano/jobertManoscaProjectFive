This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Do List:

### Cards can be matched(DONE!)

### Timer starts ticking when game starts(WIP)

### Reveal cards when game starts


## Styling

### Add splash screen
Show logos of the people who made the original game this project is based on.

### Add disclaimer
I don't own any of the pictures used so add a window that says that with a continue button.

### Actually display the cards in a grid
Put the cards in a flex container or something to display them properly. 

### Display cards properly
Only show the backs of the cards and only reveal them when the javascript tells it to. Match should only be written on the card when the cards are matched.

### Animate Flipping
